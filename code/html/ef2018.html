        Technology.
        <p>
        From robotics to computer science, from programming JAVA and Python to HTML and CSS, from welding robots to developing websites, I thought I was quite involved with technology.
        <p>
        Well, I wasn’t wrong, but I wasn’t quite right. I still had more to learn.
        <p>
        Hello, my name is Seok Hee and this is my story from my 2018 summer trip to Germany and Switzerland, learning more about the influences of technology on society.
        I was very fortunate to be able to travel to Germany and Switzerland with EF this past summer, where I learned the endless extent of cultural diversity, the magnificent distinctness of European architecture, and the continuous advances in technology. From Berlin to Heidelberg in Germany, all the way to Lucerne and Zurich in Switzerland, every place I had visited had a special story behind it.
        However, there is one specific place that resonated as a powerful, revolutionary location that would truly change the world with its technology.
        Freiburg. The Green City.
        <p>
        To give a little background information about Freiburg, it is a city of about 220,000 people, located in the southwest corner of Germany, at the edge of the Black Forest and near the borders of France and Switzerland.
        This revolutionary place had me think so much more of how to apply technology to real life, and I mean real, real life.
        <s><p>
        But before I start, I think it is important to make a statement that technology is not only tech, engineering, robotics, mechanics, or electronics. Technology is anything that uses the scientific knowledge to solve problems in practical method.
        Now, let’s begin.
        <p></s>
        <b><u>I. TransporTECHtion (Transportation)</u></b>
        <p>
        Transportation in Freiburg is visually pleasing yet safe and efficient. Freiburg is a compact city with strong neighborhood centers where people’s needs are within walking distance. Within the city, individual cars are not a necessary item like in the United States. In fact, they charge you less in Freiburg for housing if you do not have a personal car, since you will not be needing a parking spot. Instead, there are three main methods of public transportation that is technologically improved to fit the needs of the people.
        <p>
        Bikes, and I mean bicycles, are the popular form of transportation within Freiburg, which is a safer and healthier inexpensive alternative compared to personal vehicles. As I was walking through Freiburg, I saw lots, and lots, and lots of bikes. They even had a special sign for bike riders, which was quite interesting to see. <s>Freiburg had developed over 400 km of cycle paths, including bike-friendly streets, streetside bikepaths, and about 9,000 bicycle parking spaces.</s>
        Bikes, as many would know, is an economically affordable substitute to personal cars, with a price difference of tens of thousands of dollars. That is, not to mention the eco-friendliness of bikes, with no gas emissions to worry about.
        <p>
        The public transportation system is convenient, fast, reliable and comfortable, not to mention afforable thanks to Freiburg’s administration to promote public transit. Some ways that Freiburg improved their trams and trains, is to plant grass on tracks. I know what you’re thinking. What? Grass on tracks? But hear this out, this method has multiple benefits: First, it sucks up the water whenever it rains, so that the tracks aren’t quite as slippery. Second, it reduce noise levels, which makes nearby living residents happy and satisfied. It also reduces the heat on the tracks during the summer, to reduce risks of track expansion and also the overall heat that comes from the tram. Not to mention, it also looks nicer, more aestheticism added onto the technological beauty of the system.
        <p>
        Lastly, if you ever need a personal vehicle for the day, but you don’t have one, have no fear! Carsharing is here! The corporation <b>Grüne Flotte (그루나 fㄹ오ㅌ)</b>, literally meaning Green Fleet, is a carsharing method to meet an individual’s need for a personal vehicle. These special vehicles are located around the city, with a website or app that consumers are able to use to rent the vehicle at any time, anywhere.
        These inexpensive methods of transportation lead to an economically efficient and environmentally friendly cycle of living. The alternatives given by Freiburg allows residents of all backgrounds, cultures, and income to have no problem transporting themselves to any part of the city. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you are from, you have all of the methods in Freiburg to go where you want.
        <p>
        <b><u>II. ArchiTECHture (Architecture)</u></b>
        <p>
        One cool thing about Freiburg is that they do not work with real estate for purchasing houses. I know what you’re thinking, wait what? Freiburg has special constructors, called <b>Bauen Gemeinschaft</b> literally meaning build community, who are private builders who plan and design apartments, buildings, and common areas for the city.
        In comparison to real estate purchases, individuals in Freiburg are allowed to give input on how they want their personal space to look and function. Not only will the inhabitants be able to live in an area they helped create themselves, but they will be paying significantly lower costs, due to the elimination of commissions and profits compared to a property developer.
        The lower costs for living, along with their personal preferences being accounted for, allows all of the residents to have homes that is economically efficient for themselves.
        <p>
        <b><u>(III.) + Renewable Energy (Renewable Energy)</u></b>
        </p>
        <p>Adding on to the architecture chapter, renewable energy in Freiburg is known to be implemented everywhere, especially on houses and buildings.
        Many houses that are developed have a common baseline of eco-friendliness. This includes heat recovery cycles using ventilation systems, inverted blinds, shaped rooftops on balconies, and of course, solar panels on everything.
        <p>Freiburg also has a magnificent solar-powered rotating house called the Heliotrope that is the first of three buildings that is entirely renewable, emissions free and CO2 neutral. The wife of architect Rolf Disch is known to live in this structure, which physically rotates to track the sun, allowing it to harness the maximum natural sunlight and warmth possible.
        The increased usage of renewable energy and the small architectural changes in the lowered costs of everyday living is truly an inspiration to improve the standards of living everywhere. This way, technology not only improves and sustains the environment, but it also offers better alternatives for those in need of economically cost-effective substitutes.
        <p>
        <b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>
        <p>Technology is powerful, and there is still much to learn from it.
        <p>As mentioned before, technology not only sustains the environment, but it also decreases the gap of poverty and inequality, which is happening right now, everywhere in the world.
        Living in the United States, where poverty fluctuates between 12 to 13 percent per year, and inequality gaps are harming the rights of civilians, there indeed exists technology that improves this situation, proven in the Green City of Freiburg, Germany.
