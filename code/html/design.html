      <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
      <div class="graphic" style="width: 70%; margin: auto;">
        <p>After coding a program that recolored images, I thought, 'This would look really nice if I can make a
          postcard or a poster out of it.' Research told me that the process I needed to practice was 'vectorizing images.' After
        a few weeks of planning and convincing my parents to buy Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator (they ended up
        buying me the entire suite, which was pretty sweet), I finally began my journey as a graphic artist.</p>
        <p>The pictures on the left were the images I used as a base, which then I started drawing similar shapes
        and patterns to match the image.</p>

        <p>Computer Science was a subject that I picked up my sophomore year (last year), when I first learned the beauty
        and joy of computing. Many of my projects were unable to post, but I have a few that were done in HTML/CSS/JS that
      I was able to upload to this website. I'm planning to put more on soon, so keep looking around!</p>
